Welcome to FaunaFinder! Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application, FaunaFinder (the "App"). Please read this privacy policy carefully. If you do not agree with the terms of this privacy policy, please do not access the application.

We reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy at any time and for any reason. We will alert you about any changes by updating the "Last Updated" date of this Privacy Policy. You are encouraged to periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed of updates. You will be deemed to have been made aware of, will be subject to, and will be deemed to have accepted the changes in any revised Privacy Policy by your continued use of the App after the date such revised Privacy Policy is posted.

This Privacy Policy does not apply to the third-party online/mobile store from which you install the App or make payments, including any in-game virtual items, which may also collect and use data about you. We are not responsible for any of the data collected by any such third party.

## COLLECTION OF YOUR INFORMATION

We may collect information about you in a variety of ways. The information we may collect via the App depends on the content and materials you use, and includes:

### Personal Data

While using our App, we may ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you. For FaunaFinder, this is primarily in the form of images you upload for analysis.

### Derivative Data

Information our servers automatically collect when you access the App, such as your unique device ID, your mobile operating system, and your model and manufacturer of your mobile device. Specifically, we collect:

*   **Device Identification:** We use a unique device identifier to associate your device with your account and purchases. We may use the Identifier for Vendors (IDFV) on iOS devices and the Android ID on Android devices. If these are not available, we may generate a unique UUID and store it locally on your device.
*   **Device Information:** When you first use the App, we may collect your device name, operating system name and version, device brand, and model. This helps us to optimize the App for your device.

### Financial Data

All financial information is stored and processed by our payment processor, [RevenueCat](https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy). We do not collect or store any financial information on our servers. You are encouraged to review their privacy policy and contact them directly for responses to your questions.

## USE OF YOUR INFORMATION

Having accurate information about you permits us to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience. Specifically, we may use information collected about you via the App to:

*   Provide the core functionality of animal identification from the images you provide.
*   Create and manage your account, including your scan history and purchase credits/subscriptions.
*   Process payments and refunds.
*   Monitor and analyze usage and trends to improve your experience with the App.
*   Perform other business activities as needed.
*   Prevent fraudulent transactions, monitor against theft, and protect against criminal activity.

## DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION

We may share information we have collected about you in certain situations. Your information may be disclosed as follows:

### By Law or to Protect Rights

If we believe the release of information about you is necessary to respond to legal process, to investigate or remedy potential violations of our policies, or to protect the rights, property, and safety of others, we may share your information as permitted or required by any applicable law, rule, or regulation.

### Third-Party Service Providers

We may share your information with third parties that perform services for us or on our behalf, including payment processing, data analysis, hosting services, and customer service. Our key service providers are:

*   **Google Cloud Platform (GCP):** Our backend infrastructure is hosted on GCP, which includes our servers (Cloud Functions) and data storage (Google Cloud Storage). Images you upload are stored securely on Google Cloud Storage.
*   **Google Gemini:** We use Google's Gemini AI service to perform the animal identification. Images you submit for analysis will be processed by this service.
*   **RevenueCat:** We use RevenueCat to manage in-app purchases and subscriptions.

We encourage you to review the privacy policies of our third-party service providers.

## SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION

We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your personal information. We use signed URLs for uploading images directly to Google Cloud Storage, which means your images are sent securely without passing through our servers first. While we have taken reasonable steps to secure the personal information you provide to us, please be aware that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse.

## POLICY FOR CHILDREN

We do not knowingly solicit information from or market to children under the age of 13. If you become aware of any data we have collected from children under age 13, please contact us using the contact information provided below.
